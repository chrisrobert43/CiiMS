# CiiMS Core Scripts
Also known as Cii, these classes and components _power_ all of CiiMS.

## Assets and Dependencies
Assets are managed through npm, grunt, and bower. If you want to hack with CiiMS core, run the following commands

```
npm install
grunt
```

Bower dependencies are installed through grunt. jQuery upgrades are handled through the bower.json file for ease of use
