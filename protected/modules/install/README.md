# CiiMS Installer Module

This is a generic Yii installation module that is used to bootstrap your application for installation. It was created to work with [CiiMS](https://github.com/charlesportwoodii/CiiMS), and is highly dependant upon the ```Cii``` core component that is part of CiiMS.

This package was built to pre-bootstrap CiiMS until it can be passed off to Yii Framework for CiiMS core installation and migration of the database. For the most part, the installer will take care of all the major issues in setting your site up for you.

## Disclaimers

While this module is generic enough to be used in other Yii applications with some tweaking, it is dependent upon the ```Cii``` core component, and will produce errors until that is remedied.
